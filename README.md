# Whatsapp Chat Analysis

A tool to calculate the frequency of messages sent in a whatsapp chat.

## Usage

### Global linking (prefered)

1. `pnpm install` - Install dependancies
2. `npm link` - Make global
3. `whatsapp-chat-analysis --help` - Show help text

### Binaries

Binaries are avaliable and attached with each [release](https://github.com/jamesatjaminit/whatsapp-chat-analysis/releases/latest).

Global linking is prefered since:

- Releases may be outdated
- Binaries are bloated since they are not native
